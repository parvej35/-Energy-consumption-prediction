# Energy consumption prediction through automating data collection steps, optimizing data processing and visualization errors 
### A comprehensive energy management system
Ten Kate produces sustainable animal fats and proteins for a variety of industries.
I did my internship in this company as a part of my Master's program.

During the internship period, I processed & analyzed the production data using the programming language Python and other related packages and libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, etc. To visualize the data, I have developed an application in the Django framework. 

I also have developed a Machine Learning model to predict future energy (Electricity and Steam) consumption amounts. So far the model can predict up to 95% accurately.Ten Kate produces sustainable animal fats and proteins for a variety of industries.
